Set the preferences in preferences.php.  (Most preferences not yet in use, but will be at next release. They're just a placeholder for the things to come.)

Also, please set your credentials for CloudSandra in php-cloudsandra.php.


After you set your preferences, open install.php.

If you get success messages, you're all set!

If you get a single failure message at the top that says "ColumnFamily not created!"  that just means that this is not the first time you (or your token and accountId, more specifically) have run this script.  It's fine.  If you get any other failure messages, contact Isidorey and we should get you straightened out right away.


Then, just run it!
